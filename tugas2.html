<p The K-series is, without a question the favorite swap for front wheel drive Hondas. Fans of golden era 90s Hondas have been binning their D, F and even B series engines in favor of the K-series since they hit the scene in the early 2000s.The Honda K-series was first offered in 2001 in the hot hatch Type-R trims of the Civic and Integra and is still offered today in DI form on several Honda or Acura models. Nearly a 20 year life span means that there are plenty of variants of this engine to choose from. The most popular models for swaps and performance applications are the early K20 engines from the 2001 through 2006 EP3 Civic and DC5 Integra and the K24 engines from the 2002 through 2008 Honda Accord and Acura TSX Often touted as the best performing package are a hybrid combination of both with the high-flowing K20 head and the larger displacement K24 bottom-end. n recent years the rear wheel drive K-swap market has exploded with several aftermarket manufacturers producing rear wheel drive gearbox adapters, conversion parts and even full kits to swap the K-series into the Honda S2000, Mazda RX-7, Mazda MX-5 and even Nissan S and R chassis cars With pieces and parts from these manufacturers and a little fabrication knowledge, it is possible to put Hondas venerable 4 cylinder into virtually any chassis you prefer.

	<h1>K series overview</h1>
	<p>At first glance, Hondas K series doesnt appear to be worth any high-performance merit. Just another pedestrian 4-cylinder mill, known for excellent gas mileage. From the factory, its a bit boring having no turbo and a modest redline. What’s not immediately evident is the platforms potential. A robust all-aluminium, DOHC engine outfitted with a coil on plug ignition system, roller rockers, forged crankshaft, cast iron sleeves and Hondas venerable i-VTEC which includes electronic lift control and variable timing control on one or both cams.Simple and ingenious in design, Honda’s electronic lift control allows one single camshaft to have, effectively, two profiles. The low profile provides miserly fuel economy in cruising situations and a more aggressive high cam profile providing greater airflow and top-end performance. New for a Honda 4-cylinder in 2001, the K-series had Variable Timing Control via ECU controlled hydraulically adjustable cam gears.
